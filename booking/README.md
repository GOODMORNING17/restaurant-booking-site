#### Description:
My final project homade will be a website for customers to reserve a table in our restaurant. It is a website that was written in Python with Flask in the back-end and able to run SQL for database query. For the front-end application, javascript was used to provide mini features. HTML and CSS was used to create the content, layout and style of the webpages. homade is a restaraunt selling pastries and cooked dishes like basque burnt cheesecake, madeleines and pizza. homade is a restaurant in Singapore. Due to the recent rullings on Covid-19 in Singapore, there can only be 2 pax max dining in the restaurant. Therefore, I have curated this website based on the current Covid-19 situation in Singapore. Moving onto the mechanics of my website!

Firstly, on the registration page, customers are required to fill in their names and contact numbers for recording purposes, so that we can contact them in case of any need of cancellation. Also, they will be required to fill in their passcode to register for an account so that they can log back in if they wish to cancel their reservation at a later time or wishes to book another time slot with us in the future.

In the login page, customers will be required to fill in their name and password to login to their account.
After loging into their account, they will greeted with our beautiful homepage with a scenic view from our restaurant windows and a few photographs of our food. There is a reservation button at the botton and at the top right hand corner for them to click into.

Then, they will be led to the reservation page whereby they can choose the time slots available. Time slots are only available on a weekly basis to prevent other customers from booking very far in advance. Customers will then be tasked to check our checkboxes regarding the rules of our reservations and dining in.

After reserving a timeslot, they will be led to the booking page where the customers will be able to see their booking timeslots and granted the ability to cancel their reservation.

As regards to the timeslot availability, the admin of the page will be granted with a special account whereby he/she is able to change and add timeslots to the website, via an "Admin" name and their preferred choice of password. Moreover, the admin will be able to see the name, contact, time and dates of the bookings of different customers.

That will be all for my website for my restaurant, homade. Hope my website makes it easier for my customers to reserve a table at our restaurant. Thank you!
